### Publish/Subscribe

The transport is [unicast-only](/transports/types.md#unicast-only-transports) and does not provide built-in support for [publish-subscribe messaging](/nservicebus/messaging/publish-subscribe/). Publishing events to multiple endpoints is achieved with multiple transport-level sends to each destination. Subscriptions are created using [persistence-based and message-driven mechanics](/nservicebus/messaging/publish-subscribe/#mechanics-message-driven-persistence-based).
